<h2>Software Engineer – Backend Java Developer at Infrrd</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Role and Impact:</strong><br>
  At Infrrd, I worked as a Backend Java Developer, contributing to a product that transformed how documents are
  processed and managed. Collaborating with a dynamic team, I took on challenges that ranged from building efficient
  processing pipelines to enhancing secure user logins.
</p>
<h3>Key Contributions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Streamlined Document Processing:</strong> I helped design a feature that intelligently scans diverse storage
    systems to identify documents that need processing. Using advanced algorithms and priority queues, we balanced
    workloads and cut down processing latency by about 20%.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enhanced User Authentication:</strong> I played a vital role in implementing a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution
    using Spring Security SAML and OAuth. This made a huge difference by reducing the login process for over 500 users
    from 5 steps to just 2 — making the platform both more secure and user-friendly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Innovative Document Classification:</strong> I introduced a heuristic-based system for classifying similar
    documents, achieving near-perfect accuracy without heavily relying on machine learning. This approach ensured fast
    and efficient processing while maintaining high precision.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>System and Quality Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a message-queue based load balancer, contributing to a modular, event-driven architecture designed to
    support fluctuating workloads.
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrated real-time monitoring into our machine learning pipelines, enabling swift anomaly detection and
    automatic failure tracking for millions of document fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    Optimized MongoDB collections by refining indexing and aggregation pipelines, ensuring smooth handling of large
    documents (300+ pages).
  </li>
  <li>
    Embraced Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices to build a robust JUnit test suite, reaching 92% code coverage
    and ensuring high-quality, maintainable code.
  </li>
</ul>
